      <h3>The Art Movement</h3>
      <p>According to the British Museum, the Orientalist art movement refers 
        to "the representation of the East in Western art which often blurred 
        the line between fantasy and reality." The movement took place during 
        the 18th and 19th century, a time in which interactions between east 
        and west slowly began to switch from just trade-oriented to that of an 
        oppressed versus opressor relationship.

          <h3>Post-Colonialism</h3>
          <p>With the end of the colonial era in the 20th century many
            eastern philosophers and academics began deconstructing the movement 
            of orientalism, questioning the motivations behind the western concept that
            depicted people from the east as 'exotic others' meant to be objectified
            by the west. One of these thinkers is Edward Said who laid the foundations
            for Orientalism as a nuanced academic study.

          <h3>Modern Concept</h3>
          <p>Through its definition in Edward Said's book, Orientalism is now
            understood to be an othering idea. Now, academics breakdown the concept
            of orientalism by questioning what it means to be labeled as the "orient"
            within the context of the 21st century riddled with the legacy of colonialism.
