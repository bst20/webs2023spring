    <h2>What is <em>Orientalism</em>?</h2>

    <p>Orientalism as defined by scholar Edward Said is a "created body of theory and practice" in which images of the East, also refered to as the Orient, 
      are presented through a Western lens for the consumption and pleasure of the West, also refered to as the Occident.</p>
    <br/>
    <p>Said defines the concept of orientalism through the 'us versus them' construct in his 1978 book titled <em>Orientalism</em>.</p>

      <h2>Historical Overview</h2>
      <p>Over time as intereactions between the east and west increased the term <em>orientalism</em> evolved from just an academic discipline to become an ideology rooted in harmful and inaccurate depictions of the east as constructed by the west. 
        Now, many people commonly refer to the term to describe the <em>othering</em> of the east and other non-white cultures that dominate the global east.
