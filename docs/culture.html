        <h2><em>"The Turkish Bath"</em></h3>
        <p>Turkish baths, hamams, and the Ottoman 'harem' were among the obsessions
          of the orientalist art movement. Both concepts exagerated to hypersexualize
          and objectify eastern women, whom often dressed modestly.

        <h2><em>"From Harem" Osman Hamdi Bey</em></h3>
        <p>In their own depictions Ottoman painters depicted the true nature
          of the baths and harems, which embodied the idea that women had their 
          own spaces in which they weren't subject to the objectifying gaze of men.
          Osman Hamdi Bey was among one of the prominent 19th century Turkish painters who
          painted the harem space in an effort to reclaim the culture that was often
          misrepresented by the west.

          the West still incorporates elements of orientalism in its paintings.

          symbol of exotism in relation to the middle east.
