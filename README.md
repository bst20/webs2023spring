Proposal:

For my website I'd like to create something that is both educational and interesting to look at. The website will be called something like "Deconstructing Orientalism" and will be an educational guide in which people can learn what orientalism is, how it shapes the perception of middle eastern cultures and how people from these cultures try to break out of its constraints by reclaiming their culture. While the main focus is to educate people and unpack misconceptions and prejudice, I also want to use this website to highlight the visual aesthetics of middle eastern cultures -- particularly Turkish culture given that I myself am Turkish.
Here's a rough sketch of what I want the website landing page to look like. I especially like the idea of having the main header feature some type of Turkish/Persian rug design.
